## üîß Technical Implementation

The monetization system is already implemented with these key components:

### BillingManager (`/app/src/main/java/.../billing/BillingManager.kt`)
- Handles Google Play Billing connection
- Manages product details and purchases  
- Includes comprehensive error handling and analytics

### SupportUsScreen (`/app/src/main/java/.../ui/screens/SupportUsScreen.kt`)
- Beautiful Material 3 donation interface
- Dynamic pricing from Play Store
- Success/error handling with user feedback

### RatingAndSupportDialog (`/app/src/main/java/.../ui/components/RatingAndSupportDialog.kt`)
- Smart timing: Shows after 7 days, respects user preferences
- Promotes both rating and donations
- Respects "Don't show again" choice

## üìä Analytics Tracking

The app automatically tracks:
- `donation_attempt`: When user clicks a donation tier
- `donation_result`: Success/failure/cancellation
- `rating_dialog_interaction`: User interaction with rating dialog
- Firebase Crashlytics integration for debugging

## üöÄ Release Process

1. **Build Release APK/AAB**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bundleProductionRelease
   ```

2. **Upload to Play Console**:
   - Upload the signed AAB to Production track
   - Complete store listing if not done

3. **Verify In-App Products**:
   - Ensure all 3 products are created and activated
   - Test on internal testing track first

4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Firebase Analytics for donation metrics
   - Monitor Crashlytics for any billing issues

## üé® Customization

### Modify Donation Amounts
Edit the product prices in Google Play Console. The app will automatically reflect the new prices.

### Change Dialog Timing
In `RatingAndSupportDialog.kt`, modify:
```kotlin
// Show after 7 days if not shown before, or after 30 days if shown before
val daysToWait = if (lastShown == 0L) 7 else 30
```

### Add More Tiers
1. Add new product IDs in `BillingManager.DONATION_PRODUCT_IDS`
2. Create corresponding products in Play Console
3. Update `SupportUsViewModel.mapProductDetailsToTiers()`

- **Privacy Focused**: No personal data collection, only anonymous analytics

## üìà Expected User Flow

1. **Day 1-6**: User uses app normally
2. **Day 7**: Rating & Support dialog appears
3. **User Options**:
   - **Rate 5 stars**: Opens Play Store
   - **Support Development**: Opens SupportUs screen
   - **Not Now**: Shows again after 30 days
   - **Don't Show Again**: Permanently dismissed

## üí° Best Practices

4. **Transparency**: Clear about what donations support
5. **Privacy commitment**: Reinforced throughout the app
